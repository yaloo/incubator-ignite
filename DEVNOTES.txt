With LGPL dependencies:
  mvn clean package -DskipTests -Prelease,lgpl

With LGPL dependencies and Scala 2.10:
  mvn clean package -DskipTests -Prelease,lgpl -Dscala-2.10

Look for incubator-ignite-<version>-bin.zip in ./target/bin directory.

NOTE: JDK version should be 1.7.0-* or >= 1.8.0-u40.

Ignite Release Instructions
===========================
Use people.apache.org/keys/committer/<username>.asc key to generate KEYS file.
Execute these commands at source root:

gpg --list-sigs <keyname> >> KEYS
gpg --armor --export <keyname> >> KEYS

Specify gpg profile at settings.xml. It will be used to sign sources and artifacts.

<profile>
   <id>gpg</id>
   <properties>
      <gpg.keyname>keyname</gpg.keyname>
      <gpg.passphrase>passphrase</gpg.passphrase>
   </properties>
</profile>

Ensure you have RELEASE (not SNAPSHOT) version at Ignite poms.
Maven release plugin release:prepare goal can be used to make release tag.

Deploy Ignite release candidate to maven repository and dev-svn:

   mvn deploy -P apache-release,gpg,release,scala,lgpl,deploy-ignite-site -Dignite.edition=fabric -DskipTests -B

   Binary artifact name can be changed by setting additional property -Dignite.zip.pattern.
   Sources package name is fixed. Sources package zip will be created automatically when apache-release profile used.

   In case you want to release both fabric and hadoop editions you have to build hadoop first, save /target/bin/*.zip,
   make "mvn clean" and restore them before deploy step.

   Nexus staging (repository.apache.org) should be closed when mvn deploy finished.
   Checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/ignite svn. Create new folder with name equals to released
   version at svn root. Copy target/site folder content to svn/ignite/<version> folder and commit.
